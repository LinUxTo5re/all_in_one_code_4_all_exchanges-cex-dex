# Arbitrage Opportunities with CEX and DEX using Python

This GitHub repository contains code and resources for identifying and exploiting arbitrage opportunities between centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) using Python.

## Overview
Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of price differences between two or more markets to make a profit. In the cryptocurrency world, arbitrage opportunities often arise due to variations in prices and liquidity across different exchanges.

This project aims to provide a framework for identifying and capitalizing on arbitrage opportunities between CEX and DEX platforms. By leveraging Python and relevant APIs, users can automatically monitor and analyze price discrepancies to execute profitable trades.

## Features
- **Price Monitoring**: The codebase includes functionality to monitor prices on multiple CEX and DEX platforms in real-time.
- **Data Aggregation**: Relevant market data, such as order book information, trade history, and liquidity, is collected and aggregated for analysis.
- **Arbitrage Detection**: The system identifies potential arbitrage opportunities by comparing prices and liquidity across different exchanges.
- **Trading Execution**: The project provides implementation for executing trades automatically or generating alerts for manual trading.
- **Backtesting**: Users can perform historical data analysis and backtesting to evaluate the effectiveness of various arbitrage strategies.
- **Data Visualization**: The repository includes tools for visualizing market data and performance metrics, aiding in decision-making.
